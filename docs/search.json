By deploying PyTorch models directly to the edge, I eliminated cloud latency, ensuring real-time inference while maintaining a serverless Lambda backend for asynchronous data aggregation and analytics.\n\n\n\nView Code on GitHub\n\n\n\nCarbon-Aware Agentic Scheduler\n\nA multi-agent system built with LangGraph that dynamically schedules AI training jobs based on real-time grid carbon intensity. By integrating “Watcher” and “Scheduler” agents, the system autonomously shifts heavy compute workloads to low-carbon time windows, achieving a demonstrated 13.4% reduction in CO2 emissions during simulation.\n\n\n\nView Code on GitHub"
