# 1. Churn Investigator: Enterprise Risk Radar
<span class="tech-tag">LangGraph</span> <span class="tech-tag">Neo4j</span> <span class="tech-tag">SQLite</span> <span class="tech-tag">Ollama</span>

An industrial-grade analytics platform predicting customer churn through friction mapping.

* **Hybrid RAG Architecture:** Orchestrates queries across SQLite (1M+ rows) and Neo4j (Graph Logic) to solve context blindness.
* **Engineering:** Solves the hallucination problem by restricting the AI to describing observations while delegating decision-making to the database logic.

# 2. The Operational Empathy Engine
<span class="tech-tag">Neo4j</span> <span class="tech-tag">SQLite</span> <span class="tech-tag">Llama 3</span>

Bridging the gap between On-Time Performance (Hard Data) and Passenger Sentiment (Soft Data).

* **Workflow:** A "Service Twin" that performs a Federated Join between operational flight logs and unstructured passenger reviews.
* **Tech:** Uses Llama 3 locally to extract sentiment and Neo4j to map relationships, identifying routes that are "Operationally Efficient" but "Experientially Failing."

# Foundational Data & Academic Research

## 3. EuroAgri Pipeline
<span class="tech-tag">Neo4j</span> <span class="tech-tag">Pandas</span> <span class="tech-tag">ETL</span>

An open-source data backbone for precision agriculture that processes high-resolution NetCDF climate data and NUTS2 administrative boundaries to generate granular crop-variety recommendations.

**Engineering Accomplishments:**

* **Key Innovation:** Implemented a transparent Heuristic Imputation Engine (NPK v01) to estimate critical Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium levels from soil texture and organic matter, bypassing the lack of direct NPK data in global datasets.
* **Architecture:** Transforms tabular "Source of Truth" Parquet files into a Neo4j Knowledge Graph, enabling complex semantic queries like identifying high-risk disease zones across NUTS2 regional boundaries.
* **Resource Optimization:** Integrated the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation to calculate precise Net Irrigation Needs by comparing weekly soil water storage against effective rainfall.

## 4. Net-Load Forecasting (Master’s Dissertation)
<span class="tech-tag">Bayesian LSTM</span> <span class="tech-tag">Uncertainty Quantification</span>

* **Research:** Investigated the intersection of probabilistic deep learning and out-of-distribution detection to solve the "context blindness" of traditional energy forecasting during rapid Atlantic weather shifts.
* **Model:** A modular stack using walk-forward cross-validation to compare DeepSVDD and One-Class SVM detectors against a Bayesian baseline, achieving reliability through strict temporal integrity and residual-based alerting.
